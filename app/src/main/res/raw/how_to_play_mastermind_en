<p><strong>How to play Mastermind</strong></p>
<p>Mastermind is a game in which one player (known as the "code breaker") attempts to determine the code of colored pegs set up by the other player (known as the "code maker").&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code is formed using pegs from a pool of colors allowed by the variation of the game that has been chosen.&nbsp; This pool of colors is either 4 colors (red, green, blue, and yellow) or 6 colors (red, green, blue, yellow, white, and black).&nbsp; In some variations of the game, colors are allowed to be duplicated in a code (such as blue, yellow, blue, green) while in others, they cannot be used more than once in a code.&nbsp; Note that there is nothing that prevents a code breaker from using the same color more than once for a strategic purpose even if playing a variant in which the code maker cannot duplicate colors.</p>
<p>In order for the code breaker to determine how close their guess is to actual secret code, the code maker responds by indicating how many exact (correct color and well position) matches are in the guess by using black pegs and how many inexact (correct color in the wrong well position) matches are in that guess by using white pegs.</p>
<p>In this version of the game, the device is <em><strong>always</strong> </em>the code maker.&nbsp; Instead of responding using pegs as in the board game, its responses are coded as white numbers on a black background (correct color and well position) and black number on a white background (correct color in the wrong well position).</p>
<p>Game begins with the code maker creating a secret code across the wells permitted by the game variation (4 wells or 6 wells).&nbsp; The code breaker has up to 10 chances to guess that code, each time modifying the guess based upon the code maker's responses about exact and inexact matches in the previous guesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are different variations of the game that introduce different levels of complexity.&nbsp; The easiest is limiting the code to 4 non-duplicating colors in 4 wells.&nbsp; The next level up permits using 6 non-duplicating colors in 4 wells.&nbsp; The "traditional" Mastermind game allows 6 colors in 4 wells and permits colors to be duplicated as many times as the code maker desires.</p>
<p>This game also introduces a pair of challenging 6 color/6 well variants for enterprising master minds.</p>
